# Intro about the React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Make sure .env.staging file is present in the source code as it has the Alchemy API Key to retreive ethereum data for an address and also modified package.json to execute
with this file.

I would recommend to use Opensea API as it has stable connection and more details will be available.It would require apporval process to get API Key only available for company purposes.

For test purpose , I have created free API Key with Alchemy just to get NFT Details from ethereum address.
